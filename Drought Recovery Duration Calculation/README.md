Data Directory Overview

This directory documents the structure, provenance, and role of all datasets used in this study.
Due to the large volume and licensing constraints associated with climate and remote-sensing data, raw data files are not hosted in this repository. Instead, this directory provides a transparent description of the data organisation and processing logic to support full reproducibility.

All datasets used in this study are derived from publicly available sources, and can be reconstructed using the preprocessing notebooks and scripts provided in the repository.
